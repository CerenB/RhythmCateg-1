If you lose the pulse, try to find it again as soon as you can. 

It can happen that at some point you feel a different pulse than the one you are tapping right now (for example slower or faster). 

You CAN change the pulse you are tapping. 

But also, try not to change too often. Try to keep the pulse as stable as you can. 

The music should have a heartbeat without too much arrhythmia ;)
