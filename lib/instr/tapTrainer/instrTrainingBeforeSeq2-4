One important note!

We often use music that might be simple 
for some people but difficult for others. 

Even if you are not able to tap well, please keep trying. 

By pushing you to your limits, we are learning a lot! 

Always remember that you are giving us important data, 
even if you are not able to tap perfectly all the time!
