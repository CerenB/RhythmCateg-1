What is a pulse? Pulse is like a “heartbeat” of music. 

Sometimes, this “heartbeat” can be marked by a prominent sound, like a bass drum. 

Here is an example.  When you press ENTER, the music will start. 

Listen carefully if you can feel the pulse. When you feel it, try to 
tap your finger on SPACEBAR in synchrony with this pulse. 

After some time, we will add “clap” sounds to the music, to show you where the pulse can be felt. 

After the claps are added, synchronize your tapping to them. 

You will receive feedback about your tapping error. 

If your tapping is precise, the claps will get softer and softer and eventually disappear. 

Keep tapping the pulse after clap-sounds disappear. If you are precise, the music will stop!
