Perfect! 

So you just tapped a pulse at a different speed as before. 

But it was still a plausible pulse because it was: 
1) stable and regularly spaced (like a good healthy heartbeat)
2) synchronized to the music                                  


This was the final example of the introduction part. 

In the following experiment, you will be listening to very similar rhythms
as in the last two trials of this introduction. Your task will be to find 
and tap a plausible pulse yourself.
