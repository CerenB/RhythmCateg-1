Here we will show you an example where we can feel the pulse, 
but it is not exactly marked by a specific sound all the time. 

The instructions are the same as before. 

First try to find and tap the pulse on your own. 

After some time, we will add clap sounds to show you a plausible pulse. 

When the claps are added, synchronize your taps with them and be as precise as possible. 

If you tap well, the clap sounds will get quiet and eventually disappear. 

Do not stop tapping the pulse until the music stops!
