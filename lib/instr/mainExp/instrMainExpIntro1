Welcome to the main experiment. 


You will hear similar rhythms as in last two trials in the training. 

You probably remember how it sounded. It was just simple tones playing simple rhythms. 

But remember, even simple music like this can make us feel the pulse. 

Your task will be to tap the pulse you feel when listening to the sounds. 

No bass or clap sounds will be presented this time. It is all up to you now!
