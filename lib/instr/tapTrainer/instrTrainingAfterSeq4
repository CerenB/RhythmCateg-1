Great!

So you saw that even very simple percussion music can make us move to the pulse. 

But is there only one plausible pulse? 

In all the previous examples, we used the clap (or bass) sound, 
to mark only one plausible pulse for you. 
 
In fact, there are many different pulses that could work. 

There are only two requirements for a good pulse: 
1) it must be stable and regularly spaced (like a good healthy heartbeat)
2) it must be synchronized to the music (it needs to feel right)!        

For instance, in the previous examples, you could have tapped 
twice as slow (skip every second tap), and it would still work. 

We will explore this in the last example.
