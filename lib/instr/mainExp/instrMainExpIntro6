For the tapping itself, use the hand you prefer. 

Remember, you will be tapping a lot, so try to find a movement that is comfortable, 
and try to keep the movement consistent across the trials. Do NOT change hands. 


If you feel like moving other body parts (like your foot or head) while tapping, you CAN do so.
