Here, we will play the same simple rhythm as we did in the previous trial. 

But, we will show you a different plausible as before. It might feel a bit faster. 

This time, you will hear the bass drum from the beginning. 

Synchronize your taps to it as before, and keep going even when the bass goes silent.
