OK, so we will play a simple rhythm. Imagine it is real music. 

Can you feel a pulse when listening to this rhythm? 

First try yourself and tap the pulse, as in the trials before. 

After some time, we will add a bass drum sound that will mark a plausible pulse (note 
that we used a clap sound in previous trials). 

Synchronize your taps to the bass sound. 

If you are precise, the bass will get quite, and disappear. 

Keep tapping the pulse!
