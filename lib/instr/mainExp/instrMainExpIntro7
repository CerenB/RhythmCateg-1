OK, that is all. 


Now, make sure you sit comfortable and that you are ready. 


Before proceeding, we will recap the main points one more time: 

1) You will hear very simple rhythmic music. 

2) When the music starts, find a plausible regular pulse and synchronize your 
taps to it on [SPACEBAR]. 

3) Use the hand you prefer and keep the movement consistent. 

4) You can tap any pulse that is like a good heartbeat (regularly spaced and synchronized with the music)

5) You can change the pulse you are tapping, but try not doing it too often. 

6) Do not think about it too much! Keep it natural. 


OK, now you are ready to do it!
